Budget monitoring web application tailored especially to you

## Features

- Witty README
- Revolutionised .gitignore file
- Hopes for a bright future
- Clean minimalistic design of Sign In/Up pages
- License file, because I modified somebody's work (due to different Bootstrap versions) and I feel obligated to let you know that I didn't do the macros from scratch (credits for [Marc Brinkmann](https://github.com/mbr) for his [Flask-Bootstrap](https://github.com/mbr/flask-bootstrap))
